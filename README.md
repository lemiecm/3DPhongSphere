# 3DPhongSphere
Create 3D sphere with applied Phong Shading.

## Description
• in the center of the scene there is displayed a sphere,
• sphere is created from the triangular mesh,
• each mesh vertex should contain position and vector normal to the
cylinder surface in that position,
• whole model has defined material properties,
• on the scene there should be defined white point light source illuminating the sphere,
• color of each triangle pixel should be calculated from the light position, material properties, position of the pixel in the scene and it’s
normal vector using the Phong shading model.
• in order to solve the visibility problem project uses backface culling
algorithm.

## Additional info
• user can move the camera that the scene is observed from,
• camera looking at the scene center,
• zooming in and zooming out the camera towards and away from the scene
center,
• rotating camera along X and Y axes.
