# 3DPhongSphere
Create 3D sphere with applied Phong Shading.<br />

## Description
• in the center of the scene there is displayed a sphere <br />
• sphere is created from the triangular mesh <br />
• each mesh vertex should contain position and vector normal to the 
cylinder surface in that position<br />
• whole model has defined material properties<br />
• on the scene there should be defined white point light source illuminating the sphere<br />
• color of each triangle pixel should be calculated from the light position, material properties, position of the pixel in the scene and it’s
normal vector using the Phong shading model<br />
• in order to solve the visibility problem project uses backface culling
algorithm<br />

## Additional info
• user can move the camera that the scene is observed from<br />
• camera looking at the scene center<br />
• zooming in and zooming out the camera towards and away from the scene
center<br />
• rotating camera along X and Y axes<br />
